# EVM Transaction Spammer

**A high-performance TypeScript SDK for orchestrating massive transaction loads against EVM-compatible networks.** 
Designed for infrastructure engineers, protocol developers, and node operators who need to validate system resilience under stress.

## Overview

The `TxSpamSDK` solves the problem of generating realistic, high-throughput blockchain traffic. Unlike simple scripts that loop transactions, this SDK provides a structured **Orchestrator** capable of managing thousands of concurrent workers, complex mixed strategies, and strict gas boundaries.

Built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh), it leverages modern asynchronous patterns to maximize throughput while maintaining a minimal memory footprint.

## Key Features

<div className="features-grid">

### Mixed Strategy Support
Don't just spam meaningless transfers. Configure complex load profiles like **"50% Writes, 48% Reads, 2% Deploys"** to mimic real-world network usage or specific attack vectors.

### Gas Guardian
Strictly enforce gas limits (`maxGasLimit`) across all concurrent workers. The Orchestrator tracks cumulative usage in real-time, ensuring your test sequence halts exactly when intended—preventing accidental fund drainage or testnet saturation.

### Mass Concurrency
Instantiate hundreds of ephemeral "Worker" wallets derived from a single root key. The SDK handles nonce management, funding distribution, and parallel execution automatically.

### Plug-and-Play
Zero-config support for local **Anvil** nodes. Simply plug in your RPC URL and Root Private Key, and the SDK handles the rest.

</div>

## Use Cases

- **Node Benchmarking**: Test the throughput limits (TPS) of your execution client (Geth, Reth, etc.).
- **Mempool Stress Testing**: Flood the network to observe transaction propagation and mempool behavior under load.
- **Block Builder Validation**: Verify that your block builder correctly constructs blocks under high contention.
- **Devnet Simulation**: Generate background traffic on development networks to create a "lived-in" environment for UI testing.

## Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @developeruche/tx-spammer-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @developeruche/tx-spammer-sdk
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @developeruche/tx-spammer-sdk
```

:::warning
**Safety First**
This tool is a **weaponized load generator**. It consumes real ETH for every transaction sent.
- **NEVER** run this against Mainnet unless you are explicitly stress-testing a production capability and are prepared to lose funds.
- **ALWAYS** use with a local Anvil node (`anvil`) or a disposable testnet account with a capped balance.
